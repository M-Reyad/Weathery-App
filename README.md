Weather Application to get a live atmospheric temperature and weather state

In this app I used a free API from openWeatherMap.org, from which I could get the atmospheric temperature and climate state.

This app was a great step in iOS learning path and could be accomplished by the help of Udemy Course "iOS bootcamp by Angela Yu"

Any comments are welcome.
